# Let's Chat About Text Editors

## What is a text editor?
A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on
your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that
allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write
to build a web site. The text editor has to be one of the most
important tools you can use as an aspiring web developer.

While text editors are largely similar and tend to be different versions of the same flavor, there are a few things that developers look for when choosing one:

* **Code Completion** - Code
completion allows you to start typing, and the code completion
feature will display possible suggestions based on what you originally
typed. This saves you time by providing a choice, rather than allowing
you to finish typing and possibly encounter typos.
* **Syntax Highlighting** - Syntax highlighting is a feature that takes the text you
type, and makes it more noticeable by colorizing the text. Attributes
are a different color than elements. And elements are a different color
than copy. This makes it so much easier when you’re looking for an
error and you can’t find it. As well as making your text easier to read.
* **Themes** - These themes will allow you to change the color of
the background of your text editor, the series of colors in your text,
and sometimes themes will affect other aspects of your text editing
software as well. Usually, web developers use a dark background and
brightly colored text. This combination seems to be easier on the eyes
—but there are other themes to choose from as well. Since you’ll be
using your text editor most of the time, it’s good to find a theme that
might reduce eye strain and fatigue.
* **Extensions** - Extensions are like
plugins for your text editor, that allow you to have superpowers that
you wouldn’t have otherwise. A text editor that has a great selection
of extension will ensure that you have the ability to add functionality
as you need it.

## One important distinction to note is the difference between a *Text Editor* and an *IDE*.

**Text Editors** edit and manages text. 

**IDEs** are a text editor, a file
manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package.

## Here are some important things to remember when working with Terminals

* **Command Line** - Also known as a terminal, a command line is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.
  * A prompt is typically followed by a command. This is language designed to tell the Terminal to perform a command. 
  * Commands are separated by spaces.
  * Most commands produce output and it will be listed straight under the issuing of the command. Other commands just perform their task and don't display any information unless there was an error.
* **Absolute Paths** - Absolute paths specify a location (file or directory) in relation to the root directory. You can identify them easily as they always begin with a forward slash ( / ).
* **Relative Paths** - Relative paths specify a location (file or directory) in relation to where we currently are in the system. They will not begin with a slash.
