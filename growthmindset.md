#### You may ask yourself, "Self, What is a Growth Mindset anyway?" 

**Growth mindset is all about believing in yourself. It can be intimidating to learn new things because we are often times conditioned to expect immediate results with minimal effort. Having a growth mindset helps us persist through _challenges_, approach new ideas with _optimism_, and dig deep to push through those challenges knowing that the reward is knowledge and new _opportunities_.** 

A quote comes to mind that touches on the idea of a Growth Mindset:

>**If you will it, it is no dream**  Theodore Hertzl, State Of Israel
