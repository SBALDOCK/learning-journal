### So you want to learn about why Markdown is the coolest thing sliced bread, huh?

#### To begin, Markdown is a simplified way to write for the web. ** With simple _commands_, you can style text without knowing a thing about code. Pretty cool, right? ** Here are a few highlights...

* You can write in **bold** by using ** in front and back of a word
* You can write in *italics* by placing a * in front and back of a word
* Heck, you can even [add links](https://www.theperfectloaf.com/) with very simple commands

I have three things I'd like you to do, which you can mark complete with an X when you're done:

- [ ] Read more about Mastering Markdown [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
- [ ] Review some basic information about Github Pages [here](https://pages.github.com/)
- [ ] Create a Github account to check out all the cool things you can do!

#### Let's chat a bit about Github Pages

Github is a simple way to create a website and share your cool ideas with the world. With just a few clicks, put something beautiful into the world with little or no technical knowledge at all!

Here are some basic steps to get set up:

1. Go to [Github](www.github.com) and create a new repository
2. Scroll down to Github pages and choose a theme
3. Use the editor to edit your content and create your beautiful site
4. ** Select _commit changes_ when you are sure about the content you've created **
