## Today was a crash course in failure. 

### While I'm exhausted and a bit frustrated with my inability to make things work the way I envision them to, I am ultimately satisfied with my progress. 

### There are a few concepts that were at the core of both my failure and my self-satisfaction. 

* I learned several important commands today that will build a foundation upon which many more skills will be built. 
    * mkdir - New folder or directory
    * ls - list files and folders
    * cd - Change directory
    * pwd - Present working directory
    * touch - Create a file
    * cat - contents of a file
* Perhaps the most vital of the commands I learned today is the add-commit-push process to get changes made locally up to Github. It took me a while to finally get the hang of this, and much of that had to do with confusion with heirarchy in my files/folders. Now that I've made it through the process successfully several times, my confidence is beginning to build. 
* Although I haven't executed on this yet, I learned the importance of including a specific comment when committing and pushing changes. I can see how important this is when the need arises to look back at the historical record to find a previous version of a file. 
* Speaking of, it was nice to gain a basic understanding of git and GitHub. I have a solid grasp on the concept of version control and the benefits it has, especially when in collaboration across a team or even multiple teams. 
* Another nice little hack I learned is how to embed .md fiiles into an existing file through our table of contents exercise. 

### To conclude, I'm very much looking forward to my continued failure, now knowing that only through that failure will I find some meager success!
