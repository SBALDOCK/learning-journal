#### Introducing How Computers Work

* Bill Gates is rich
* Computers are widely used, but misunderstood
* How is information represented inside a computer?
* How does software control hardware?

#### What Makes A Computer, A Computer?

* May-Li is a great designer, obviously
* Computers are everywhere
* Computers are tools that help us solve problems
    * Specifically with the thinking work we do
* Take input, store information, process, output results
    * Common to all computers
* Inputs give a computer information, which is then stored in memory
* Processed information sent back ready for output
* 

#### How Computers Work: Binary & Data

* Computers work on 1s and 0s
* Wires and circuits carry all information
* Single wire can be on or off
    * yes or no, true or false, one or zero
    * bit - smallest piece of information it can store
    * The more 1s and 0s, the more information it can store
* 10 digits - 0-9
* Binary system only has two digis
    * You can count up to any number
    * 9 in binary is 1001
* Any number can be represented with only 1s and 0s
* 32 wires - 0 to over 4 billion
* All text, images and sound can be represented with numbers
* Pixels - Each pixel has a color, represented by numbers
* Every sound is a series of vibrations
    * Can be represented graphically as a wave form, or a number
    * More bits means a higher ranger of numbers

#### How Computers Work: Circuits and Logic

* Every input or output is a type of information represented by on or off information
* Computers modify and combine signals
* Circuits are millions of tiny electronic components
* Not circuit - Signal that goes in is different than that which goes out
* There are many circuits that perform simple calculations
* Adder - Two bits added together to calculate the sum

#### How Computers Work: CPU, Memory, Input & Output

* Input - Convert into binary information
* CPU - Central processing unit where calculations are performed
* Press a key, converted to a number, cpu calculates, requests instructions from memory, runs results, sent in binary to screen, convert to colors, letters, etc. 
* The more information that comes in, the more power a computer needs to process

#### How Computers Work: Hardware and Software

* Hardware - Physical things
* Software - programs and code
* CPU - master chip that controls all other parts
    * Smallers simpler parts within that handle simple tasks
    * Circuits to do various things
    * The magic is how it knows which circuits to use and when to use them
