## Putting it all together - How HTML, CSS, & JavaScript work together

### JavaScript is the third of the three primary languages that are used to bring a website to life. The other two are *HTML* and *CSS*

#### Each language can be considered a distinct layer with a unique purpose. Each layer builds upon the previous. 

* HTML is the content layer
* CSS is the presentation layer
* JavaScript is the behavior layer

#### The exercise displayed how to create a basic HTML 

* To use JavaScript, use the HTML <!---<script>--> to tell the browser it is encountering a script. The src attribute indicates where the JavaScript file is stored. 
* You can also place the script directly in the HTML, but just like CSS, it is recommended to use a separate file.
* Objects - the Document object represents the entire web page.
* Method - the Write method allows the new content to be written into the page where there <!--<script>--> element is.
* The browser stops to load a script where it finds it and determines what action to take. 

## Basic JavaScript Instructions

* Each individual instruction in JavaScript is known as a **statement**
    * An example is var today = new Date();
    * Note that Javascript is case sensitive
* Statements are instructions and each starts on a new line
* Be sure to write **comments** to explain what code does
    * You can comment using /* */
    * You can write multi-line comments
* A single-line comment is anything following //
* Variables can be used to represent values in your scripts that will perform the same even if the data being run is different
* To declare a variable, announce it with *var*
* Then add a variable name, followed by a semi-colon
* You can assign the variable a value using **=**
* **Booleans** are true or fales values. They are a form of data type
    * Other data types are numbers and strings
* In order to store a number using a variable, declare the variable and name, and then add the value. 
* Strings should be placed in quote marks 
    * They can be single or double quotes
* You can also use a variable to store a string or Boolean
* There is a shorthand language for variables
* You can change the value of a variable with a Boolean
* There are six rules for naming variables
    * The name must begin with a letter, dollar sign or an underscore
    * The name can contain letters, numbers, dollar sign, or an underscore
    * You cannot use **keywords** or **reserved** words
    * Variables are case sensitive
    * Use a name that describes the information
    * If your variable is made up of more than one word, use a Capital letter for the first letter of every word *after* the first word

    ## Someday, this will all make sense to me!
