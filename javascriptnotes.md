## Intro + Scripts

### JavaScript makes web pages more interactive

* You can use it to access content
* You can use it to modify content
* You can set program rules
* You can run a script that reacts when an event has occurred
    * Button pressed
    * link is clicked

* The power of Javascript is being able to change content of an HTML page while it is loaded
    * Some examples are a slideshow that you can click through, a form that is filled out by a user, a partial reload of a page when an action is taken, or a data filter
* 
### Scripts

* A series of instructions
    * Similar to a recipe, a handbook, or a manual
* A browser may use different parts of the script depending upon how the user interacts with the page
* In order to write a script, state a goal and then list tasks to complete the goal
    * Write this down
    * Wireframe or instructions step by step
* Start with the big picture
    * Define Goal
    * Design Script
    * Code each step
* Each task can be broken into a series of steps, which are then translated into individual lines of code
    * Task example is cleaning a room, while there are many smaller individual steps within that task
* Sketch out tasks in a flow chart to understand the process and how the goal can be reached through each task and series of steps

### Expressions and Operators

* An **expression** results in a single value
    * There are expressions that just assign a value to a variable
        * *var color = 'beige';*
    * There are expressions that use two or more values to return a single value
        * *var area = 3 * 2;*
* **Expressions** rely on **operators**, which allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values

    * Assignment operators - *color = 'beige'*;
    * Arithmetic operators - *area = 3 + 2;*
    * String operators - *greeting = 'Hi' + 'Molly';*
    * Comparison operators - *buy = 3 > 5;*
    * Logical operators - *buy = (5 > 3) && (2 < 4);*

* Several arithmetic operators can be used in on expression, but there is an order of calculation, similar to math. Multiplication and division is performed before addition and subtraction
* To change this order, place a calculation you want performed *first* in parentheses

* String operators use the *+* symbol to join strings on either side of it
    * This process is called **concatenation**
    * var firstName = 'Ivy';
    * var lastName = 'Stone';
    * var fullName = firstName + lastName;

### Functions

* Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. Functions can be reused if different parts of the script repeat the same task
* When asked to perform a task, it is known as **calling** a function
* Pieces of information passed to a function are **parameters**
* When you write a function and expect it to provide an answer, the response is a **return value**
