Growth mindset is all about believing in yourself. It can be intimidating to learn new things because we are often times conditioned to expect immediate results with minimal effort. Having a growth mindset helps us persist through challenges, approach new ideas with optimism, and dig deep to push through those challenges knowing that the reward is knowledge and new opportunities.
