## Comparison Operators

### Usually return single values of true or false

* == - Is equal to
* != - Is not equal to
* === - strict equal to
* !== - strict not equal to
* > greater than
* < less than
* >= - greater than or equal to
* <= - less than or equal to

## Logical Operators

### Compare results of more than one comparison operator

* && - Logical And 
    * If both return true, expression returns true. If just one returns false, then express is false
* || - Logical Or
    * Test at least one condition
    * If either expression evaluates to true, the expression returns true. If both return false, epxress is false.
* ! Logical Not
    * Takes a single Boolean value and inverts it
    * If it was false without the !, it would return true
    * If it was true, it would return falkse
    * !true returns false
    * !false returns true

## Loops

### Loops check a condition. If it returns true, a code block will run. It repeats until the condition returns false

* For - If you need run code a specific number of times
    * Most common loop
* While - If you do not know how many times the code should run
    * Continues to loop as long as the condition is true
* Do While - Similar to While, but always run the statements inside the curly brackets at least once, even if the condition evaluates to false.

### Loop Counters instruct the code to run a specific number of times

* Initialization - Create a variable and set it to 0. 
    * Also called "i". Acts as counter
* Condition - Loop continues to run until the counter reaches a specified number
* Update - Every time the loop has run the statements in curly brackets, it adds on to the counter.

## Using While Loops

* Each time the loop is run, another calculation is written into the variable called *msg*.
* Continues to run as long as the conditions in the parantheses is true
