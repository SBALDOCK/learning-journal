### Chapter 10 - Introducing CSS

## CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of an element should appear. The key to understanding CSS is to imagine an invisible box around every HTML element

* Associate style rules with HTML elements
* Affect how elements are displayed
* External CSS is a separate page to organize CSS
* Interal CSS is within the main HTML page
* Selectors target rules to specific elements
* Selectors are case sensitive
* CSS rules cascade so that if there are two or more rules that apply to the same element, the last rule will take precedence
* The more specific CSS rule will take precedence

### Chapter 11 - Color

## Color brings pages to life. There are three common ways to indicate choice of colors. 

* Foreground Color allows you to specify color inside an element
    * RGB, Hex, and Color Names are three ways to choose color
* Background-color element sets the color of the background for a box
* By default, most browsers have a white background color
* Color is a mix of red, green, and blue
* RGB values are expressed in numbers between 0 and 255
* Hex codes are represented in a hexadecimal code
* Color names are limited in selection
* Saturation refers to the amount of gray in a color
* Brightness refers to how much black is in a color
* Contrast makes text more or less eligible
* Opacity is a number value between 0.0 and 1.0
* RGBA specifies color AND opacity in one code
* Some browsers do not recognize RGBA, so you can offer a fallback solid color
* HSL stands for HUE, Saturation and lightness. This is a new way to specify color in CSS3
* HSLA adds alpha to the previous three, which means transparency
